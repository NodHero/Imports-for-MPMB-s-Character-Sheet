The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the gem with no other effect\n   Each spell gem has a maximum level for the spell it can store. The spell level determines the gem's rarity, the stored spell's saving throw DC, and attack bonus, as shown in the table below.\n   You can imbue the gem with a spell if you're attuned to it and it's empty. To do so, you cast the spell while holding the gem. The spell is stored in the gem instead of having any effect. Casting the spell must require either 1 action or 1 minute or longer, and the spell's level must be no higher than the gem's maximum. If the spell belongs to the school of abjuration and requires material components that are consumed, you must provide them, but they can be worth half as much as normal.\n   Once imbued with a spell, the gem can't be imbued again until the next dawn.\n   Deep gnomes created these magic gemstones and keep the creation process a secret.\n\n" + [

	descriptionFull : "Created by the stone giant librarians of Gravenhollow, this nineteen-inch-long shard of quartz grants you advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks while it is on your person.\n   The crystal has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it: Speak with Animals (2 charges), Speak with Dead (4 charges), or Speak with Plants (3 charges).\n   When you cast a Divination spell, you can use the crystal in place of one material component that would normally be consumed by the spell, at a cost of 1 charge per level of the spell. The crystal is not consumed when used in this way.\n   The crystal regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the crystal's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the crystal vanishes, lost forever.",

	descriptionFull : "Crafted by the drow, this slim black wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause a small glob of viscous material to launch from the tip at one creature within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged attack roll against the target, with a bonus equal to your spellcasting modifier (or your Intelligence modifier, if you don't have a spellcasting modifier) plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the glob expands and dries on the target, which is restrained for 1 hour. After that time, the viscous material cracks and falls away.\n   Applying a pint or more of alcohol to the restrained creature dissolves the glob instantly, as does the application of oil of etherealness or universal solvent. The glob also dissolves instantly if exposed to sunlight. No other nonmagical process can remove the viscous material until it deteriorates on its own.\n   The wand regains 1d6+1 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the wands last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand melts into harmless slime and is destroyed.\n   A wand of viscous globs is destroyed if exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption.",
